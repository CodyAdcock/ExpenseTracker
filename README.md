# ExpenseTracker
The idea of ​​this app is to manage your money & finances, allow you to see your spending by category, set up bill payments, keep track of your incomes, and plan for savings.

The required features of the app are:

Display and compare total cost by day, month, year.
Show your invoices during the day.
Add a new invoice.
Show categories (including food, water bills, etc).
Show categories with used invoices (for collecting purpose).
This expense management app works in the following way:

First, in the ‘Home’ screen, you will see comparative charts which will help keep track and make comparisons of the current day’s expenses. Below the charts, a list will display all invoices you have paid that day.

Next, as you click the ‘Add New’ button, catalogs will appear. Clicking on each specific catalog will lead to the next screen where you can input the amount of money and give a description for that invoice.

When things are done, the app will automatically return to its home screen. By utilizing the Tabbar navigation, you can create 3 items: Home, Activities, and Setting. Activities screen displays recorded bills in categories (for example, Food: 3 bills, Drink: 4 bills, etc). Clicking on a specific item to see the details.

‘Setting’ enables users to edit their information and images.

Here is the [link](https://dribbble.com/shots/5500007-Expense-Tracker) of the above design.

So what can you apply?
1. Chart View, Table View, Collection View: With the infinite creativity of designers, you can apply knowledge of views to create impressive screens.
2. Tabbar Navigation and View Controller Navigation.

Basically, this app does not need to apply to the server because it is used to track your own costs. However, you can still apply this by using firebase. We will mention this feature in the next parts.
